## 🎓 Tips for Success

1. **Understand, Don't Memorize**: Focus on understanding the pattern, not just the solution
2. **Time Yourself**: Practice under interview conditions (30-45 minutes per problem)
3. **Explain Your Approach**: Practice explaining your solution out loud
4. **Optimize**: Always think about time and space complexity
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Consider empty inputs, single elements, large inputs
6. **Review Mistakes**: Learn from problems you couldn't solve initially
